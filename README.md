## **How It Started (TL;DR)** 🥱😴

I came upon an article about GraphQL while browsing the web for some cool tech stuff. I got excited all of a sudden after reading that it addresses **over-fetching** (_getting more data than you need_). For most, it's not big of a deal, but for backend developers, it is sort of a challenge. Yes, I know that we can solve it by adding _more logic_ to our existing RESTful API's, but then again, that means more work for the backend people. 😭 So yeah, I like making my life easier so I chose GraphQL. 🤣 You can read more about other issues addressed by GraphQL [here](<[https://link](https://hasura.io/learn/graphql/intro-graphql/graphql-vs-rest/)>).

### RESTful API Call

![RESTful API Call](images/hasura_restvsgraph_1.png)

### GraphQL API Call

![GraphQL API Call](images/hasura_restvsgraph_2.gif)

And so I tried researching how to create a GraphQL server with Laravel since I am comfortable with it. There I found the [Laravel Lighthouse](https://lighthouse-php.com). Consequently, by pure luck, I found [**Jose Luis Fonseca**](https://twitter.com/Joselfonseca)'s package ([_joselfonseca/lighthouse-graphql-passport-auth_](https://lighthouse-php-auth.com)) which gave me instant authentication-related GraphQL mutations such as _login_, _register_, and _logout_! Thanks, Mr. Fonseca! 👏

I then studied how to create my own queries, mutations, and subscriptions but the amount of stuff to learn is **A LOT**! And so my lazy self looked for an easier route and there I found [**Hasura GraphQL API Builder**](https://hasura.io), the best friend of all GraphQL enthusiasts! 🤩

With Hasura, all you need to do is create a database table via _Hasura Console_ and all queries, mutations, and subscriptions are _automagically_ created for you!

### The **Problem** with Hasura 😱

Hasura is _almost_ perfect really. But it lacks two very important features that most developers are looking for. And those are **authentication** 🔐 and **non-database related computations** 📈📉📊.

Hasura does not have a built-in authentication system. It is by design, according to them. It _needs_ a 3rd party authentication provider like [**Auth0**](https://auth0.com), [**AWS Cognito**](https://aws.amazon.com/cognito/), [**AuthGuardian**](https://www.onegraph.com/auth-guardian/), etc. Adding custom logic on top of Hasura such as complicated computations is also not possible with Hasura. It is also by design. Either build a serverless function or create a RESTful API somewhere.

### The **Solution** to Hasura's Predicament 💡

I almost gave up with Hasura but then a question popped out of my head...

_Is it possible for Laravel and Hasura to fulfill each other's weaknesses?_

I mean just think about it...

- Hasura needs a 3rd party authentication service. Laravel can provide that easily (_via Laravel Passport_)!
- Hasura needs 3rd party serverless functions for custom computations. Laravel can provide that as well (_via RESTful APIs_)!
- GraphQL development with Laravel is really slow for beginners. Hasura can make it faster!

So yep, _theoretically_, they are match made in heaven. 😍 So the goal became how to make them work with each other.

### **The Final Product** ✨

So it took me a while (_months really since I have too much on my plate_) to finally figure out how to make 'em work with each other.

Before, Laravel can create JWT access tokens but that _isn't enough_ for Hasura since it requires `custom claims`. So I looked for a way to add some custom claims to Laravel's default JWT, and there I found the **final piece** of the puzzle, [**Cor Bosman**](https://github.com/corbosman)'s package ([_corbosman/laravel-passport-claims_](https://github.com/corbosman/laravel-passport-claims)). Thanks, Mr. Bosman! 👏

Below is the custom claims added using the package:

![Hasura Custom Claims](./images/CustomClaims.png)

Below is the [`JWT mode`](https://hasura.io/docs/1.0/graphql/core/auth/authentication/index.html#jwt-json-web-token) of authentication for the whole boilerplate:

## 🌄 **Local Deployment** 🌄

**Requires Docker v2.x or higher**

To download Docker images and create **PostgreSQL**, **MinIO** and **Hasura** containers on Docker Hub, you have to run this command:

```Batchfile
docker-compose up -d
```

To remove all containers and volumes (persistent data), you have to run this command:

```Batchfile
docker-compose down -v
```

Make sure to be on the root folder of the cloned boilerplate as this command will look for the `docker-compose.yaml`. If successful, you should see the 3 services.

### Part 1: **MinIO** Configuration 🚧

To configure MinIO to work with Laravel, follow the GIF instruction below.

![MinIO config](images/config_minio_1.gif)

**Note**: You can always choose another name for the bucket but make sure to add `Read and Write` Policy to that bucket and update the `MINIO_BUCKET` variable on Laravel's `.env` file.

---

### Part 2: **Laravel** Configuration 🚧

Laravel's files are located on the `laravel` folder. Do not rename the folder since Nginx will look for this specific folder during online deployment.

**Step 1**: Since Laravel requires `.env` file, rename the `.env.example` to `.env`. Make sure to install all Laravel dependencies by running this command:

```Batchfile
composer install
```

**Step 2**: Make sure to `generate your own app key` before anything else. App Key will be used for all sorts of encryption within Laravel.

```Batchfile
php artisan key:generate
```

![Generate New App Key](./images/01_AppKey.png)

**Step 3**: Run fresh migrations to create all necessary tables and seed the roles table as well. To add or customize the roles, look for the `RolesSeeder.php` file.

```Batchfile
php artisan migrate:fresh --seed
```

![Run Fresh Migrations](./images/02_Migrate.png)

**Step 4**: You have to generate your own OAuth Keys as well. To remove mine, just use `--force`. Make sure to paste the new grant client id and secret to Laravel's env file.

```Batchfile
php artisan passport:install --force
```

![Generate New OAuth Keys](./images/03_OAuthKeys.png)

**Step 5**: Make sure to refresh config cache to utilize the new keys.

```Batchfile
php artisan config:cache
```

![Clear Configs](./images/04_ClearConfigs.png)
**Step 6**: Run the app to test our GraphQL API. By default, the GraphQL endpoint will be at `http://localhost:8000/graphql`. You can download [**GraphiQL**](https://link) or [**GraphQL Playground**](https://link) to test this endpoint.

```Batchfile
php artisan serve
```

![Serve the application](./images/05_Serve.png)

**Step 7**: If we will try to register, the role id is **required**. We can look for the role id's via Laravel Tinker.

### Via Laravel Tinker

![Roles on Tinker](./images/06_Tinker.png)

**Step 8**: Since we now have the role id for the user, we can proceed to register an account. To register, we have to use the `register` mutation and supply all information needed. For this demo, we just need the `access_token` so we only need to specify that as the output.

```GraphQL
mutation registerUser {
  register(object:{
    given_name: "James"
    middle_name: "Sebial"
    surname: "Luchavez"
    email: "james@gmail.com"
    password: "12345678"
    password_confirmation: "12345678"
    role_id: "insert_id_here"
  }){
    tokens{
      access_token
      refresh_token
    }
  }
}
```

![Register Mutation](./images/08_PlaygroundRegister.png)

**Step 9**: Since we already registered the user above, we can now use it to login as well. To login, we have to use the `login` mutation and specify `access_token` to be the output.

```GraphQL
mutation loginUser {
  login(object:{
    username: "mrstudyfirst@gmail.com"
    password: "12345678"
  }){
    access_token
    refresh_token
  }
}
```

![Login Mutation](./images/07_PlaygroundLogin.png)

**Step 10**: The JWT `access_token` can be _decoded_ to get important information like expiration date, user information, and custom claims (_required by Hasura_). You can try at [jwt.io](https://jwt.io) and paste the `access_token`.

![JWT.io](./images/09_JWTDecode.png)

To view all authentication mutations, photos CRUD, and documents CRUD, import my **Postman Collection**: https://www.getpostman.com/collections/c58cae3c7bc6bf72462d

---

### Part 3: **Hasura** Configuration 🚧

For Hasura to utilize the tokens generated by Laravel, it needs to have the OAuth public key. Look for `HASURA_GRAPHQL_JWT_SECRET` on the `docker-compose.yaml` file and add the single-line public key. Follow the GIF instruction below for the single-line public key.

![Add Public Key to docker-compose](images/config_hasura_1.gif)

Once finished, run the following command again to recreate the Hasura container:

```Batchfile
docker-compose up -d
```

---

### Part 4: Hasura Schema Stitch with Laravel 🚧

For Hasura to get all of Laravel's Schema operations like _queries_, _mutations_, and _subscriptions_, we need to setup [Hasura Remote Schema](https://hasura.io/docs/1.0/graphql/core/remote-schemas/index.html).

Open the Hasura Console, go to **Remote Schema** tab. Click _Add_. Give it a name like "Laravel". Since this is local deployment, Hasura requires **host.docker.internal** instead of **localhost**. So on GraphQL server URL, since Laravel's GraphQL API endpoint is at _http://localhost:8000/graphql_, it will now become *http://host.docker.internal:8000/graphql*. But for deployed versions, it will require the actual GraphQL endpoint.

## 📷 **How to Upload Photo and Document** 📚

As mentioned, one vital part of this boilerplate is the storage service (**MinIO**). Before you can upload anything, you have to have a valid `access_token` and you can only get one if you have registered already. To demonstrate, **Postman** is used.

To view all authentication mutations, photos CRUD, and documents CRUD, import my **Postman Collection**: https://www.getpostman.com/collections/c58cae3c7bc6bf72462d

![List of GraphQL Authentication Mutations, Photos CRUD, Documents CRUD](images/Postman_Collection.png)

Also make sure to provide values to variables like this:

![Postman Collection Variables](images/Postman_Collection_Variables.png)

### Upload Single Photo 📷

- Endpoint: `http://localhost:8000/api/photos`
- Operation: `POST`
- Key: `photo`
- Validations: `images|max:5120` (max of 5MB)

![Upload Single Photo](images/MinIO_Upload_1.png)

### Upload Multiple Photos 📷

- Endpoint: `http://localhost:8000/api/photos`
- Operation: `POST`
- Key: `photos[]`
- Validations: `images|max:5120` (max of 5MB each)

![Upload Multiple Photos](images/MinIO_Upload_2.png)

### Upload Single Document 📚

- Endpoint: `http://localhost:8000/api/documents`
- Operation: `POST`
- Key: `document`
- Validations: `mimes:doc,docx,pdf,txt|max:5120` (max of 5MB)

![Upload Single Document](images/MinIO_Upload_3.png)

### Upload Multiple Documents 📚

- Endpoint: `http://localhost:8000/api/documents`
- Operation: `POST`
- Key: `documents[]`
- Validations: `mimes:doc,docx,pdf,txt|max:5120` (max of 5MB each)

## 🌎 **Online Deployment at [KintoHub](https://www.kintohub.com) (optional)** 🌎

Since **KintoHub**'s databases can only be accessed within their environment (which makes it really secure), I usually just deploy this setup as it is. I then connect to my Postgres database via [Kinto CLI](https://github.com/kintohub/kinto-cli), and then redeploy my Laravel application and Hasura server with updated settings.

**Note**: You can always deploy this setup on other platforms like [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com), [DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com), etc. I just use KintoHub since this is where I first deployed it and since it uses Docker by default.
